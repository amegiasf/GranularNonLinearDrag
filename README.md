# Kinetic Theory and Memory Effects of Homogeneous Inelastic Granular Gases under Nonlinear Drag: Simulation results data

This repository contains the data files for the simulation results exposed in the paper 'A. Meg√≠as and A. Santos, Kinetic Theory and Memory Effects of Homogeneous Inelastic Granular Gases under Nonlinear Drag, Entropy **24**, 1436 (2022). https://doi.org/10.3390/e24101436.'

The folders contains the following data
- stationary: simulation results of the steady states that appear in Fig. 4 of the paper.
- transients: simulation results of the transient states that appear in Fig. 5 of the paper.
- Mpemba: simulation results of transient regimes that exhibit Mpemba-like effect appearing in Fig. 6 of the paper.
- Kovacs: simulation results of transient regimes that exhibit Kovacs-like effect appearing in Fig. 7 of the paper.

The folders with the prefix 'errors' refer to the errors of the values in the corresponding folder. The files in the folder 'stationary' contain themselves the errors of the values.
